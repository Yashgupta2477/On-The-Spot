The Audi RS Q8 offers you quattro permanent all-wheel drive with optional quattro sport differential that distributes the power selectively for each wheel. The adaptive air suspension sport with characteristic RS tuning and the all-wheel steering for agile responsiveness and superb handling stability add that extra touch. The optional electromechanical roll stabilisation further enhances the driving dynamics, especially when cornering. Simply click the RS mode button on the steering wheel to modify the vehicle characteristics intuitively with Audi drive select. There is also the option to increase the top speed from 250 to 305 kmhÂ³.



The sleek instrument panel and the strong horizontal body line convey a generous sense of spaciousness. The broad, symmetrically styled centre console is a key design element, framed for example in matt carbon twill. The sport seats in a black Alcantara/leather combination with RS embossing offer excellent lateral support, even in challenging driving conditions. They are also available on request as perforated sport seats plus in Valcona leather with honeycomb pattern. Right down to the smallest detail, the optional RS design packages in grey or red and the combination of Alcantara and leather with contrasting stitching make for an even sportier ambience.


The interior of the Audi RS Q8 is equipped with a wide range of digital technologies that assist you in various ways on every journey. The RS-specific displays in the Audi virtual cockpit will give you the information about torque, performance, acceleration, lap times and G-forces as you want it.
